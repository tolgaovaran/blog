ADD MORE PERSONAL STUFF Schools and such
I can describe myself as an engineer that try to self-improve, loves to follow new tech and try to apply those tech to improve my life. I like to use and support open source tech and tools If the situation requires getting code done, I deliver high quality, clean, working code, quickly and correctly. I'm comfortable with structured code, databases, OO programming, and "specialty" languages such as might be found in workflow or business rules systems. I have every confidence that to the extent the position requires actual coding, I can sling code with the best.
